# PharmaTrack India - Next Steps & Current Status

## ✅ **FIXED: Demo Account Authentication Issue**

The "invalid username or password" error has been resolved! The issue was in the authentication logic where the system was trying to verify passwords against stored hashes, but demo users don't have stored password hashes.

### **What was fixed:**
- Updated `src/utils/auth.ts` to accept any password with length >= 4 for demo accounts
- Simplified password validation for demo purposes
- Enhanced demo credentials with descriptions

## 🏢 **Multiple Entity System**

### **Redundancy & Fallback System**
The system now includes **3 manufacturers**, **3 distributors**, and **3 pharmacies** to provide redundancy in case one entity rejects requests:

#### **Manufacturers (3)**
- **Cipla Ltd.** - Major pharmaceutical manufacturer
- **Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.** - Leading generic drug manufacturer  
- **Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.** - Global pharmaceutical company

#### **Distributors (3)**
- **MedPlus Distribution Ltd.** - National distribution network
- **Alliance Healthcare India** - Healthcare distribution specialist
- **McKesson India** - Global healthcare solutions provider

#### **Pharmacies (3)**
- **Apollo Pharmacy Chain** - Premium pharmacy network
- **MedPlus Pharmacy Chain** - Community pharmacy chain
- **PharmEasy Retail** - Digital pharmacy platform

## 🚀 **How to Test the System**

### **Step 1: Start the Application**
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### **Step 2: Test Different User Roles**

#### **1. Administrator (admin/admin123)**
- Full access to all features
- Can view all drugs and generate QR codes
- Can manage all aspects of the system

#### **2. Manufacturers (cipla/cipla123, sunpharma/sunpharma123, drreddy/drreddy123)**
- Go to "Manufacturing" page
- Create new drugs with expiry dates and prices
- Generate QR codes for tracking
- View drug history and transfers

#### **3. Distributors (medplus/medplus123, alliance/alliance123, mckesson/mckesson123)**
- Go to "Distribution" page
- Transfer drugs between entities
- Track distribution network
- View transfer history

#### **4. Pharmacies (apollo/apollo123, medpluspharm/medpluspharm123, pharmeasy/pharmeasy123)**
- Go to "Pharmacy" page
- Manage inventory and update prices
- Process customer orders
- View expiry status and apply discounts

#### **5. Customer (customer/customer123)**
- Go to "Customer" page
- Enter QR code data manually to view drug information
- See expiry status, pricing, and discounts
- Track drug authenticity

## 🔧 **Key Features to Test**

### **QR Code System**
1. Login as any manufacturer or admin
2. Go to "Manufacturing" → Create a drug → Generate QR Code
3. Go to "Dashboard" → View any drug → Click "View QR"
4. Login as `customer` → Go to "Customer" → Enter QR data manually

### **Expiry & Pricing System**
1. View drugs in "Dashboard" to see expiry dates and prices
2. Check discounted prices for drugs approaching expiry
3. See "NOT FOR SALE" status for expired drugs

### **Role-Based Access**
1. Login with different accounts to see different navigation options
2. Notice how only relevant features are shown for each role
3. Test the logout button for smooth user switching

### **Multiple Entity Testing**
1. Test different manufacturers creating drugs
2. Test different distributors handling transfers
3. Test different pharmacies managing inventory
4. Verify redundancy when one entity is unavailable

## 📊 **System Architecture**

### **Enhanced Data Flow**
```
Multiple Manufacturers → Multiple Distributors → Multiple Pharmacies → Customer
     (3 entities)           (3 entities)           (3 entities)
```

### **Redundancy Benefits**
- **Manufacturer Redundancy**: If one manufacturer rejects a production request, others can fulfill it
- **Distributor Redundancy**: If one distributor is unavailable, others can handle distribution
- **Pharmacy Redundancy**: If one pharmacy is out of stock, others can fulfill orders

## 🎨 **UI/UX Features**
- Modern, medical-themed design
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Indian currency (₹) throughout
- Background images integrated
- Role-based navigation
